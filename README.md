# [2024 Electronic Design Contest - Problem H] Autonomous Car â€” Complete Plug-and-Play Code!

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Introduction

This project is based on the SMPG03507 control board, combined with grayscale sensors and a gyroscope.
Using the PID algorithm, it dynamically adjusts the motor speed of the left and right wheels to achieve black-line tracking and control.
The car can detect black lines, follow them stably, and successfully solve Problem H of the 2024 E-Design Contest.
